	<h3>Life</h3>
	<p>Mary Wollstonecraft is considered one of, if not the, first feminists.</p>

	<p>She was born in London, the second of seven children to Edward John Wollstonecraft and Elizabeth Dixen. Born in a comfortable life, 
	her family's wealth was eventually squandered over time by her father's failed projects.</p>

	<p>Her father then insisted her inheritence would be given back to him. He eventually became physically abusive to Mary's mother. 
	   Mary would often lie outside her mother's bedroom to protect her. She had a maternal role in her younger sisters' lives as well.</p>

	<p>One solace was her friendship with Frances "Fanny" Blood, whom she credits with "opening her mind."</p>
	
	<p>Mary left her abusive household when she was nineteen years old. But only two years later, she would return home to care for her dying mother.
	   After her mother's death, Mary moved in with the Bloods. She, Fanny, and her sister Eliza would open a school together. She and Fanny dreamt of 
	   being able to live with and support eachother, independent of anyone else, but it was not feasible economically and Fanny would soon be engaged.</p>

	<p>Fanny and her husband would move to Lisbon, to help her poor health. But once she became pregnant, her health deteriorated and Mary came to nurse her. 
	Tragically, she soon passed away, and her death would profoundly affect Mary and inspire her work "Mary: A Fiction." As she had rushed to Fanny's aid, Mary
	abandoned her school and without her presence, the school had failed.</p>
        
	<p>After a brief stint as a governess, Mary began to resent the limited career options women had and she decided to leave it all to become an author.
	She wrote translations and reviews, and became involved in circles of other writers, artists, and philosophers. The French Revolution and the conversative criticisms
	of it would inspire her work "Rights of Man," a rebuttal against one such criticism. This would lead to her prominence. She would use the outlines of this work for 
	her most famous and influential piece: "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" in which she explained women needed the same educational opportunities as men.</p>

	<p>Desprite all the warnings, Mary would move to France during the Revolution and like many foreigners, would be forced to stay during the Reign of Terror. During this
	time she would meet the American adventurer Gilbert Imlay. They began a romantic relationship and he would lie about their marital status to protect her from getting 
	arrested and to help her leave France. They had a child together, named Fanny after her old friend. Their romance deteriorated after however.</p>

	<p>Upset at end of their relationship and her failed attempts at reconciliation, Mary attempted suicide.</p>

	<p>She eventually recovered and returned to London to join a circle of radicalists. She became acquainted with William Godwin again as she was before France. Their initial meetings
	led to mutual dislike. But this time, they would start a romantic relationship and would have a daughter together, Mary, would would become a renowned author in her own right as the 
	author of Frankenstein.</p>

	<p>Soon after the birth of their daughter, Mary had an infection and would pass away. Godwin would publish a memoir about her. He did not hide her illegitimate children, love affairs,
	 and suicide attempts causing controversy even after her passing.</p>

	<p>While discussions of her personal life took over discussion of her writing, she would later be vindicated as her works would become an inspiration in the feminists waves of the 1920s, 
	1960-70s, and even now.
